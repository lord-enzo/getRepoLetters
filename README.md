# Repository letter counter

Welcome! This is a small test to retrieve all JS and TS files from a repository and sort, in descending order, the
occurrence of each letter. 

By default, it's configured to check on the `lodash/lodash` repository. 

## Requirements
- You will need Node 16 (I've tested with `v16.14.2`)
- A GitHub token is needed to interact with the API due to limitations on the downloads. 

## Instructions
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm i`
- Execute `node app.js`
